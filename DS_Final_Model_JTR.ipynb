    "\n",
    "### Importing Necessary Libraries\n",
    "The script begins by importing various Python libraries necessary for time series analysis and model development:\n",
    "- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and handling.\n",
    "- **Statsmodels**: Provides tools for statistical modeling, including the ARIMA model and statistical tests.\n",
    "- **Scikit-Learn**: Offers functions for calculating model performance metrics.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**: For data visualization.\n",
    "- **Warnings**: To suppress warnings during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading and Displaying the Data\n",
    "The .csv file contains ONLY the adjusted closing price for each stock, this is for accuracy and ease-of-use\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Allocate the file path correctly as per the dataset location, simply making a note of this as it is a simple mistake I have made before\n",
    "data_file_path = '/Applications/Bellarmine DS Spring 2024/DS Senior Capstone/Final Project/merged_stocks_new.csv'\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)\n",
    "df.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Points to Note for this model and code:\n",
    "- **New File**: It's important to note that the dataset in this file only includes information for Adjusted Close Price, and as a result a new Excel file was created that contains only this information. If I were trying to predict more than one variable, I would pre-process the data differently.\n",
    "- **Model Notes**: For the model fitting and evaluation, the X-Axis ranges from 0-250, this is because the testing data is around 250 (the number of trading days in a given year) This is also testing for year 2023 based on 2018-2022 training data.\n",
    "- **Code Explanation and Markdown Cells**: This project is built in such a way that I will be able to understand each step of the ARIMA model building process. The notes, explanations, and code breakdown are not transferrable to all skillsets. Not all code utilized in this project is explained, and this project was built in such a way to streamline the ARIMA model building process as much as possible. Information and sources used for this project give heavily varied advice and suggestions, making the process very complicated to understand what is/is not best practice(s).\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Due to the amount of conflicting information on ARIMA code, models, accuracy testing, and robustness/validity; Having a 'solid' foundation of ARIMA/SARIMAX models is not possible in this length of time. Some cells of this project contain extensive amounts of code, more than I am comfortable with having in individual code cells. This model was a 10/10 in terms of difficulty for me, and as a result I can not professional articulate every single line of code. I did my best to convey as much of the process as possible, however my learning experience with ARIMA is still very much in-progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important point to consider:\n",
    "- **ARIMA Outputs**: The ARIMA outputs and subsequent plots are meant to give a visual and textual representation of model predictions. However, ARIMA does not output if the time series is stationary or other tests like autocorrelation. This has to be built and visualized. I made sure to include these in the outputs during the testing. Currently, there is not an extensive amount of comments on the results/outputs, as the purpose was to get the model to run correctly first.\n",

    "- **Model Storage**: `models` list will hold the ARIMA models created for each variable, allowing for easy access and comparison of different model configurations.\n",
    "- **Error Metrics**: The `rmse_multi`, `mae_multi`, and `ape_multi` lists are crucial for evaluating and comparing the performance of the ARIMA models on different variables. These metrics will provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the models.\n",
    "    - **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures the model's prediction error.\n",
    "    - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Evaluates the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.\n",
    "    - **APE (Absolute Percentage Error)**: Represents the error as a percentage, which can be particularly useful for understanding the relative size of the errors in terms of the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "This step is crucial for a dynamic and systematic approach to model fitting and evaluation. By organizing the storage of models and their corresponding error metrics, the script sets the stage for an in depth analysis of the ARIMA models' performance across different time series variables in the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Iterating through Variables\n",
    "The script iterates through each variable (column) in the DataFrame to fit an ARIMA model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for var in variables:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection via Grid Search\n",
    "- **Grid Search for (p, d, q) Values**: The script performs a grid search over possible combinations of (p, d, q) orders, fitting an ARIMA model for each combination.\n",
    "- **Building the script to find these values**: Due to having multiple time series (more than 1 stock), every individual time series requires different p, d, and q values in order to best fit the model and ensure best accuracy. This is the only way I could find that subsequently served as a huge time saver, and is likely best practice when handling more than one time-series.\n",
    "- **Selection Criterion**: The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used to select the best model. A lower AIC value indicates a better model fit. This is used as the criteria focus on the forecasting and predictive power of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization of ACF and PACF\n",
    "- **Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Plots**: For the best model, the script generates plots of the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF). These plots help in understanding the correlation structure of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residual Analysis\n",
    "- **Stationarity Test of Residuals (ADF Test)**: The script uses the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check if the residuals of the fitted model are stationary.\n",
    "- **Autocorrelation Test of Residuals (Ljung-Box Test)**: The Ljung-Box test checks for the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals at different lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictions and Error Calculation\n",
    "- **Forecasting**: The script forecasts future values using the best ARIMA model and compares these forecasts with the actual values.\n",
    "- **Error Metrics**: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are calculated to evaluate the prediction accuracy. Absolute Percentage Error (APE) is also computed for each forecasted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization of Predictions and Errors\n",
    "- **Prediction Plot**: The script uses Plotly to create a dynamic plot showing the actual values, predicted values, and the confidence interval.\n",
    "- **Error Plot**: A bar plot visualizes the Absolute Percentage Error for each forecasted point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- **Dynamic Approach**: The script's ability to handle multiple variables in a dataset makes it versatile for different time series datasets.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Each ARIMA model is thoroughly evaluated using statistical tests, error metrics, and visualizations, ensuring a robust analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "This process is crucial for developing reliable ARIMA models for each variable in the dataset. By systematically selecting, fitting, and evaluating the models, the script ensures accurate and trustworthy forecasts.\n",

    "## Exporting Model Residuals to Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Overview\n",
    "Upon completing the ARIMA model fitting and evaluation for each variable, the script exports the residuals of these models to individual Excel files. These files can be used for further analysis of the residuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for var, residuals in residuals_dict.items():\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterating Through Residuals**: The script iterates through a dictionary `residuals_dict`, which  contain the residuals of the ARIMA models keyed by variable name.\n",
    "- **Creating DataFrame for Residuals**: For each variable, a new DataFrame is created with the residuals.\n",
    "- **Exporting to Excel**: The residuals DataFrame is then saved to an Excel file. The filename is based on the variable name, making it easy to identify the corresponding model's residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- **File Naming Convention**: The use of the variable name in the filename (`\"{var}_residuals.xlsx\"`) ensures clarity and helps in maintaining an organized workspace, especially when dealing with multiple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "- For each variable in the dataset, an Excel file is generated, named appropriately (e.g., `SPY_residuals.xlsx`), containing the residuals from the ARIMA model.\n",
    "- The script also prints a confirmation message for each file created, like `Residuals for SPY saved to SPY_residuals.xlsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "Exporting the residuals match the request to have residuals saved for later use. Other types of regression can be performed, so this is done in the possibility of this.\n",

    "## Conclusion // Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "### This ARIMA model is an extremely powerful tool that can be used to forecast stock data with high degree of accuracy. \n",
    "The script begins by importing various Python libraries necessary for time series analysis and model development:\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: This issue seems to be possible for stocks and certain time series data. This could be something to consider in the future if I wanted to attempt to get even more accurate predictions.\n",
    "- **Unpredictability**: Forecasting stock data alwyas contains a margin of error, and even to some extent some guessing. This model (in its current form) is likely not going to be the most useful way to invest in the stock market. However, it does give me some confidence that my choices would be worth picking.\n",
    "- **Autocorrelation**: This is something that is technically present in some stocks' data such as Microsoft. In two observations in the Microsoft ARIMA, the Margin of Error jumps to 12.5% and 17.5%, I am not completely sure what this is, or even why. However it is possible that autocorrelation is present elsewhere that the model did not pick up? This does not necessarily mean that the presence of autocorrelation is a bad thing. There was also some autocorrelation for QQQ, Telsa, and Meta as well, however it was not significant enough to be a major problem in forecasting accuracy. I wonder if the high jump in forecasting percentage for single observations could be influencing this.\n",
    "- **Replicability**: The benefit to this model is that it can be used over and over again, and with some extra work could even forecast information into the next year (2024). This was not originally apart of the goal and purpose of this model, so it will not be included in this.\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: ARIMA is not very user friendly, and requires more statistical understanding than originally thought. Having worked with this model and fought with it to get it to work correctly did not make me feel very confident after all was said and done. \n",
    "- **Learning Experiences**: Having such a difficult model to learn created a hyper-organized setting in which I was able to operate. I have never needed to organize my thoughts, processes, and nuances to the degree this project has been commented. This is not standard practice for me, but took this level of organization to work through the learning curve.\n",
    "- **Similarity to Linear Regression**: ARIMA has a lot of similarities with the process I am familiar with in the context of linear regression in an Econometrics setting. Though the code and nuances differ, I noticed quickly that the process does look and feel the same with both methods. ARIMA is, however, much more robust and complex.\n",

If I had more of a solid programming foundation and experience with this particular type of model, I may be able to navigate simple errors and nuances more effectively. However, Chat GPT has many limitations, especially when it comes to building more in-depth models such as this. Without wanting to add more headache to an already extremely time-consuming project, I decided it would not be beneficial to refer to.\n"
